# Phobos
Phobos is script for dumping EVE client data into JSON format.

It uses collection of data miners which extract data from files of various formats. It does not provide stable "API" by design: if CCP changes data scheme within EVE client, output files will also change.

### A note on safety
Several data miners used in Phobos are doing potentially very dangerous thing security-wise, they are loading external code:
 
- ResourcePickleMiner: [unpickles](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/pickle.html) serialized python files
- FsdBinaryMiner: executes loaders provided by the EVE client to access data in FSD binary format
 
It doesn't mean that you should not use these miners. Generally speaking, if you trust EVE client and Phobos - you should have no issues with these miners. Phobos runs simple validation on files which will be worked upon (checksum according to the client's file registry). Still, it is recommended to run Phobos in some sandboxed environment (e.g. separate Wine prefix for Linux).

### Requirements

* Python 3.12
* 64-bit python built for Windows is needed to access data in FSD binary format

### Arguments:

* `--eve`: Required. Path to EVE client folder, e.g. `C:\CCP\EVE Online`.
* `--json`: Required. Output folder for JSON files.
* `--server`: Optional. Server to pull data from. Defaults to `stillness`.
* `--translate`: Optional. Specifies language to which strings will be translated. You can choose either individual languages (run script with `--help` argument for a list) or 'multi' option. For individual language, translation will be done in-place (replaces original text with localized text), for multi-language translation, original text is not modified, but new text fields are added, named using `<field name>_<language code>` convention (e.g. `typeName_en-us`). Multi-language translation mode is default.
* `--list`: Optional. Specifies list of comma-separated 'containers' to extract. It uses names the script prints to stdout. For list of all available names you can launch script without specifying this option, as by default it extracts everything it can find.

### Example

    $ python run.py --eve=E:\eve\client\ --json=~\Desktop\phobos_tq_en-us --list="evetypes, marketgroups, metadata"

### Phobos-specific data
Besides raw data Phobos pulls from client, it provides two custom containers.

#### phobos/metadata
Contains just two parameters: client version and UNIX timestamp of the time script was invoked.

#### phobos/traits
Traits for various ships. Data has following format:

    Returned value:
      For single language: ({'typeID': int, 'traits': traits}, ...)
      For multi-language: ({'typeID': int, 'traits_en-us': traits, 'traits_ru': traits, ...}, ...)
      Traits: {'skills': (skill section, ...), 'role': role section, 'misc': misc section}
        // skills, role and misc fields are optional
      Section: {'header': string, 'bonuses': (bonus, ...)}
      Bonus: {'number': string, 'text': string}
        // number field is optional

For example, Cambion traits in JSON format:

    {
      "traits": {
        "role": {
          "bonuses": [
            {"number": "115%", "text": "bonus to kinetic Light Missile and Rocket damage"},
            {"number": "50%", "text": "reduction in module heat damage amount taken"},
            {"text": "Â·Can fit Assault Damage Controls"}
          ],
          "header": "Role Bonus:"
        }, 
        "skills": [
          {
            "bonuses": [{"number": "5%", "text": "bonus to Light Missile and Rocket Launcher rate of fire"}],
            "header": "Assault Frigates bonuses (per skill level):"
          },
          {
            "bonuses": [{"number": "4%", "text": "bonus to all shield resistances"}],
            "header": "Caldari Frigate bonuses (per skill level):"
          }
        ]
      },
      "typeID": 32788
    },
